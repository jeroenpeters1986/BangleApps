# Clock & Calendar by Michael

This is my "Hello World". I first made this watchface almost 10 years ago for my original Pebble and Pebble Time and I missed this so much, that I had to write it for the BangleJS2.
I know that it seems redundant because there already **is** a *time&cal*-app, but it didn't fit my style.

- locked screen with only one minimal update/minute

- unlocked screen (twist?) with seconds

## Configurable Features
- Number of calendar rows (weeks)
- Buzz on connect/disconnect (I know, this should be an extra widget, but for now, it is included)
- Clock Mode (24h/12h). Doesn't have an am/pm indicator. It's only there because it was easy.
- First day of the week
- Red Saturday
- Red Sunday

## Feedback
The clock works for me in a 24h/MondayFirst/WeekendFree environment but is not well-tested with other settings.
So if something isn't working, please tell me: https://github.com/foostuff/BangleApps/issues
